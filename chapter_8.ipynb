    "- Data leakage:\n",
    "  - Survivorship bias: some stocks may have been removed from the universe at the present time while not in the beginning. Use a stsable universe like Russell 1000/3000, MSCI benchmarks, or commercial factor models investment universes.\n",
    "  - Financial statements: data is only available when the statements are released not the reference date range.\n",
    "  - Point-in-time data\n",
    "  - Price adjustments: use raw prices as much as possible. only use adjusted prices for returns calculation. If adjust prices for stock-splits, the stocks with multiple splits will have very low stock prices in the distant past, which might indicate the stock would do will in the future. This is a form of data leakage.\n",

    "The well-known cross-validation (k-fold) has drawbacks, we can't shuffle the orders of subset due to serial dependency and ease of data leakage. Walk-forward validation solves these problems but suffers from: low data volume at the beginning, opportunity cost between the last training and production (buffer = validation set)."
