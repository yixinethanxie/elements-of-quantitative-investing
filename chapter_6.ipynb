    "\n",
    "We don't know idio cov matrix before solving for factor returns, and we need idio cov matrix to solve for factor returns. It's a chicken and egg problem. We can borrow from Expectation-Maximization procedure, \n",

    "- solve for factor returns again using the new idio returns, get new factor returns and update the idio cov matrix.\n",

    "### Rank-deficient Loading Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "An example would be, a country factor and an industry factor, each asset must belong to one and only one country and one industry. Therefore, the sum of all country loadings equals the sum of all industry loadings equals a vector of ones. A vector that assign 1 to all country loadings and -1 to all industry loadings and 0 everywhere else will create a 0 vector, thus the loading matrix is rank-deficient due to non-empty null space. If $B$ is rank-deficient, so is $B^TB$ and we can't inverse it, therefore we can't get the factor returns estimate $\\hat{f}_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ways to deal with this:\n",
    "- Add ridge regularization: $||r-Bf||^2 + \\delta ||f||^2$. As $\\delta \\to 0$, this becomes ridgeless, and we can calculate the peudo-inverse of $B^TB$ for factor returns estimate.\n",
    "- Or, we can add constraint, for example: $w^TB_{ind}f_{ind}=0$, where $w$ is the firm's market cap weight, which indicates that the market-weighted industry returns must be 0."
