    "# Chapter 4 - Linear Models of Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 Factor model\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{r}_t = \\mathbf{\\alpha} + \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{f}_t + \\mathbf{\\epsilon}_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{r}_t$: asset returns at time t\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{B}$: factor loading, mapping from factor returns to asset returns\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{f}_t$: factor returns at time t\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{\\epsilon}_t$: idiosyncratic returns at t\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the factor model, the variance of returns is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\Omega_r} = \\mathbf{B{\\Omega_f}B}^T + \\mathbf{\\Omega_\\epsilon}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.1 Graphical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E\\left(r_i - \\alpha_i | f\\right) = \\sum_j \\mathbf{[B]}_{i,j}f_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each asset return, in excess of alpha, is a linear combination of factor returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E\\left(r_i - \\alpha_i | f\\right) = \\mathbf{B}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{f}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.2 Superposition of Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E\\left(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{\\alpha} | \\mathbf{f}\\right) = \\sum_j \\mathbf{[B]}_{\\cdot,j}f_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Asset return is an overlap of influences from the loading matrix weighted by the factor returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.3 Single-Asset Product\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the second equation from 4.2.1, this is used in performance attribution, more on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3 Alpha spanned and orthogonal\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is to decompose the alpha term in the factor model into orthogonal and spanned (in loading matrix B's column subspace, e.g. some linear combinations of B's columns). Some linear combination of B's columns is the defination of factor models, so spanned alpha is really just part of the expected returns of factors. On the other hand, the orthogonal alpha is not in B's column subspace and thus has the following relationship with the sharpe ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SR = \\frac{E(w^Tr_t)}{\\sqrt{var(w^Tr_t)}} \\geq \\frac{||\\alpha_\\perp||}{\\sqrt{||\\Omega_\\epsilon||}} \\geq \\sqrt{n}\\frac{\\mu}{\\sqrt{||\\Omega_\\epsilon||}}$$\n",
    "$$w = \\frac{\\alpha_\\perp}{||\\alpha_\\perp||}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that additionl orthogonal alpha increases the overall sharpe ratio, which makes it very valuable. But most of the time, the alpha is spanned, so it comes with systematic risks that can't be diversified away.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.4 Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is a bit confusing to me as I don't have experience in factor modeling, will need to revisit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotations\n",

    "General form:\n",

    "$$\\tilde{B} = BC^{-1}$$\n",
    "$$\\tilde{f} = Cf$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't change the overall modeling, just some information transferred between the factor returns and the factor loading matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identity factor covariance matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn the factor return covariance into identity, so the factors are uncorrelated and have unit variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Omega_f = USU^T$$\n",

    "\n",
    "transform loading matrix into z-scores for each row, helps interpret the influence of each factor on each asset returns. \n",

    "$$e = Ba = (1,1,...,1)^T$$\n",
    "$$C^{-1} = I + aa^TB^Tdiag(v)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second equation may not exist for any $B$. This step centers each row with the offset $v=(v_1,...,v_n)^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "To scale to unit variance, we can multiply for $diag(k_1, ..., k_n)$, so\n",
    "$$C^{-1} = \\left(I + aa^TB^Tdiag(v)\\right)diag(k)$$\n",
