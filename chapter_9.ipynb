    "The lower the volatility constraint, the higher the $\\lambda$ and the higher the penalty term.\n",

    "We can actually get this solution without formally solving the optimization problem. Again, the optimal weight is proportional to $\\Omega_r^{-1}\\alpha$. Since the constraint is always binding, we know that the portfolio's expected return must be $\\mu$. Therefore, we just need to scale $\\Omega_r^{-1}\\alpha$ so that its expected return is $\\mu$\n",

    "- if assets are uncorrelated, $C=I$, then the optimal sharpe ratio is $||s||$ (squared sharpe!)\n",
    "- if assets are correlated\n",
    "  - the vol allocation is proportional to the deviation of asset sharpe to the average sharpe, i.e. overweight if sharpe is above average, vice versa\n",
    "  - the optimal sharpe increases as\n",
    "    - the number of assets increases\n",
    "    - asset sharpe dispersion increases (interesting)\n",
    "  - the sharpe is upper-bounded by $s/\\sqrt{\\rho}$ if all assets have the same sharpe\n",
    "\n",
    "To further interpret the center piece $\\Omega_r^{-1}\\alpha$, we use that:\n",
    "$$w_i \\propto [\\Omega_r^{-1}]_{i,i}\\left(\\alpha_i - \\sum_{j\\neq i} \\rho_{i,j} [\\Omega_r^{-1}]_{j,j} \\alpha_j\\right)$$\n",
    "$\\rho_{i,j}$ is the correlation of asset $i$ and asset $j$ after removing their collinearity with the other assets:\n",
    "- Regress the returns of asset $i$ and asset $j$ on the returns of the other asset.\n",
    "- $\\rho_{i, j}$ is the correlation between the residuals from the two regressions above.\n",
    "So the interpretation of the above equation are:\n",
    "- diagonal terms of a precision matrix are always positive\n",
    "- if two assets share overlapping information after removing the correlations with the other assets, then the allocation to asset $i$ should be reduced."
