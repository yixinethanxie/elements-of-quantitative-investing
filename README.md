# Project: Study Notes of *the Elements of Quantitative Investing*

## Project Goal

This is a repository study notes for Gappy's New Book, *the Elements of Quantitative Investing*, published in 2025. I plan on a few rounds of reading and note-taking:
- First pass: read the book and take notes on key concepts and ideas with jupter notebooks.
- Second pass: consolidate notes into a few projects and write-ups.
- Third pass: polish the write-ups and submit to arxiv. re-factor the project codes into some reusable libraries.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository structure will undergo changes as I progress through each pass, but for the first pass, the repo will be organized by chapters.

## How to Contribute

This project welcomes feedback and suggestions. If you have insights, additional references, or corrections, please submit them via GitHub issues or pull requests.
