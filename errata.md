page 29, equation 2.5, the right side on the first inequality should be $1/\left(2\sqrt{2\pi}\right)$
page 83, third equal sign, $E(\epsilon^2|x) + E\left[(\hat{y} - E(y|x))^2|x\right]$
page 86, exercise 4.2 part 2, min_i {\lambda_i}^2 \leq h^2? maybe? but rayleigh-ritz theorem??
page 91, (4.28) missed {v_i}^T $${u_i}^Tu_j = \frac{{v_i}^T(A^TAv_j)}{s_is_j} = \frac{{s_j}^2{v_i}^Tv_j}{s_is_j} = \frac{s_i}{s_j}{v_i}^Tv_j = \delta_{i,j}$$
page 95, 5.1.1, loss function should be: $$\bar{L} = 1/T\sum_{t=1}^TL(\tilde{\sigma}_t^2, \hat{\sigma}_t^2)$$
page 100, exercise 5.1, H=rr^T makes the loss function -infty
